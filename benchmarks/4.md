# Отдача динамического документа через проксирование запроса с nginx на gunicorn;

I set this config with forwarding but the result was even slower.

```nginx
upstream askme {
    server web:8000;
}


server {

    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://askme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;

    }

    location /static/ {
        alias /home/app/web/static/;
    }

    location /media/ {
        alias /home/app/web/media/;
    }

}
```
