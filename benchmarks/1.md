# Отдача статического документа напрямую через nginx

With the following nginx configuration:

```nginx
upstream askme {
    server web:8000;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location /static/ {
        alias /home/app/web/static/;
    }

    location /media/ {
        alias /home/app/web/media/;
    }
}
```

and default [compose](prod/docker-compose.yaml) \
I call the :1337/media/avatars/default.png as it is a static image on a docker volume

```bash
root@4881703-xr27905:~/VKEdu-WebTech/prod# ab -n 2000 -c 100 localhost:1337/media/avatars/default.png
